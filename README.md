# Historical Manuscript Generator

## Description

This is a simple web application that generates stylized images resembling historical manuscripts. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Konva.js library to render text with a historical-looking font onto a textured background. Each time you click the "Generate Manuscript" button, new text snippets are randomly selected and displayed with subtle variations in style.
